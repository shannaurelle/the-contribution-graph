# the-contribution-graph
A recreation of Github contribution graph using HTML and CSS
## Feature
Default colors, square shape style with month names on proper days. 
## Roadmap
1. Make the colors easy to adjust
2. Make the months rotate based on desired starting/ending month
3. Make the chart responsive (for smaller screens it should display vertically)
